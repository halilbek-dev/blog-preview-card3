### Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./preview.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I challenged to nest these horizonatal and vertical layouts in one box, I thought I can do it easily after first frontend mentor but it took me 2 days to complete and it helped me to find some best resources and  what i learned from this project overall is i must not stop learning. 

### Continued development

For a long time I didn't watch any tutorial because I thought I can't learn but the rule is watch an hour and practice it four hours, I looked at past with failures as a result I didn't learn but now I learn first the basic then practice for hours

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I highly recommend braking github reposotries on vscode; this helps to learn faster and learn, build, fail, repeat technique is LBFR; from now I decided to watch an hour tutorial on HTMl and css then 3-4 hours practice includes this frontend mentor challenges and learning github reposotries and giving them feedback to boost knowledge. Ask yourself how would i build it? what would be different? what is good and bad about this project? so I wish you and i do them.
